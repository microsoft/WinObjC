    <!-- Make sure that the output artifacts are included in the build. This means adding include paths and link libraries for it.

         NOTE: It is important that this information is added at the end in the .targets instead of in the .props so that consumers don't
         accidentally stomp it. This is contrary to a configurable type property that a consumer may want / need to adjust. To depend on
         this package means the consumer gets these these things.  -->
