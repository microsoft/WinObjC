# Welcome to the Windows Bridge for iOS Project
The Windows Bridge for iOS (also referred to as WinObjC) is a Microsoft open-source project that provides an Objective-C development environment for Visual Studio and support for iOS APIs. The bridge allows you to create Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps that will run on many Windows devices by re-using your Objective-C code and iOS APIs alongside Windows 10 features like Cortana and Windows Notifications.

## Download and Installation
To use the bridge you'll need:
- **Windows 10**, build 10586 or higher. Validate your version number [here](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/which-operating-system).
- **Visual Studio 2017** with Windows developer tools. Visual Studio 2017 Community is available for free [here](https://dev.windows.com/downloads).

  
   Ensure the following individual components are selected during installation. Selecting the Universal Windows Platform development workflow should give most of the below 
   
   **NOTE:** Please also install the **Mobile development with .NET** workflow option (Xamarin Tools) due to a bug in Nugetizer (See [Issue 5026](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/5026))

To get started with an existing Xcode Project, you will also need:
- **Chocolatey**, a package manager for windows. See how to install the latest version [here](https://chocolatey.org/)
- **winobjc-tools**, the command line tools for WinObjC. Run the below command from **powershell (Admin)** to get the latest version:
```
choco upgrade winobjc-tools
```
(more information about this command and its options can be found [here](https://chocolatey.org/docs/commands-upgrade). If you want to use develop packages add `--pre` to the command.)

## Getting Started With the Bridge
### Importing your Xcode Project
When using the bridge, the first thing you'll want to do is generate a Visual Studio solution from your Xcode project:

1. Open Windows PowerShell (type **powershell** in the Start Menu to find it) and navigate to your Xcode project directory using the **cd** command. Note: use the directory containing your .workspace or .xcodeproj folder.

  ```
    C:\> cd C:\MyProject
  ```
2. Run the vsimporter tool. This will generate the Visual Studio Solution:

  ```
    C:\MyProject> vsimporter.exe
  ```
3. Open the generated Visual Studio solution with the command:

  ```
    C:\MyProject> MyProject.sln
  ```

For more detailed step by step instructions on how to import a project, see the [Quick Start Tutorial](https://github.com/Microsoft/WinObjC/wiki/Quick-Start-Tutorial) page of the wiki. For vsimporter options and known issues, check the [Using vsimporter](https://github.com/Microsoft/WinObjC/wiki/Using-vsimporter) wiki page.

### Analyzing your App
After importing your project, we strongly suggest using the [App Analysis Tool](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/bridges/ios/app-analyzer-tool) to have a better understanding of the compatibility of your app with the bridge.

### Building & Running the Samples
A great way to learn more about the bridge and its features is building and running the samples of the SDK, which contain many code examples. We recommend starting with the **WOCCatalog** sample app, which demonstrates an assortment of iOS and XAML UI controls:

1. Clone the repo.
2. Navigate to the *samples/WOCCatalog* directory of the bridge SDK
3. Double-click on the **WOCCatalog-WinStore10.sln** solution to open it in Visual Studio
4. In Visual Studio, right-click on the **WOCCatalog (Universal Windows)** project
5. Select **Set as StartUp project**
6. Use **Ctrl-F5** to build and run the app

For more detailed step by step instructions, see the [Quick Start Tutorial](https://github.com/Microsoft/WinObjC/wiki/Quick-Start-Tutorial) page of the wiki.
