        @discussion
            CFErrors are used to encompass information about errors. At minimum, errors are identified by their domain (a string) and an error code within that domain. In addition a "userInfo" dictionary supplied at creation time enables providing additional info that might be useful for the interpretation and reporting of the error. This dictionary can even contain an "underlying" error, which is wrapped as an error bubbles up through various layers. 
            
            CFErrors have the ability to provide human-readable descriptions for the errors; in fact, they are designed to provide localizable, end-user presentable errors that can appear in the UI. CFError has a number of predefined userInfo keys to enable developers to supply the info.
            
            Usage recommendation for CFErrors is to return them as by-ref parameters in functions. This enables the caller to pass NULL in when they don't actually want information about the error. The presence of an error should be reported by other means, for instance a NULL or false return value from the function call proper:
            
            CFError *error;
            if (!ReadFromFile(fd, &error)) {
                ... process error ...
                CFRelease(error);   // If an error occurs, the returned CFError must be released.
            }
            
            It is the responsibility of anyone returning CFErrors this way to:
            - Not touch the error argument if no error occurs
            - Create and assign the error for return only if the error argument is non-NULL
            
            In addition, it's recommended that CFErrors be used in error situations only (not status), and where there are multiple possible errors to distinguish between. For instance there is no plan to add CFErrors to existing APIs in CF which currently don't return errors; in many cases, there is one possible reason for failure, and a false or NULL return is enough to indicate it.

            CFError is toll-free bridged to NSError in Foundation. NSError in Foundation has some additional guidelines which makes it easy to automatically report errors to users and even try to recover from them.  See http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ErrorHandlingCocoa/ErrorHandling/chapter_1_section_1.html for more info on NSError programming guidelines.
