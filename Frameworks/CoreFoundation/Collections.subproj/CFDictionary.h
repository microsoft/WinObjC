	@header CFDictionary
	CFDictionary implements a container which pairs pointer-sized keys
	with pointer-sized values. Values are accessed via arbitrary
	user-defined keys. A CFDictionary differs from a CFArray in that
	the key used to access a particular value in the dictionary remains
	the same as values are added to or removed from the dictionary,
	unless a value associated with its particular key is replaced or
	removed. In a CFArray, the key (or index) used to retrieve a
	particular value can change over time as values are added to or
	deleted from the array. Also unlike an array, there is no ordering
	among values in a dictionary. To enable later retrieval of a value,
	the key of the key-value pair should be constant (or treated as
	constant); if the key changes after being used to put a value in
	the dictionary, the value may not be retrievable. The keys of a
	dictionary form a set; that is, no two keys which are equal to
	one another are present in the dictionary at any time.

	Dictionaries come in two flavors, immutable, which cannot have
	values added to them or removed from them after the dictionary is
	created, and mutable, to which you can add values or from which
	remove values. Mutable dictionaries can have an unlimited number
	of values (or rather, limited only by constraints external to
	CFDictionary, like the amount of available memory).

	As with all CoreFoundation collection types, dictionaries maintain
	hard references on the values you put in them, but the retaining and
	releasing functions are user-defined callbacks that can actually do
	whatever the user wants (for example, nothing).

	Although a particular implementation of CFDictionary may not use
	hashing and a hash table for storage of the values, the keys have
	a hash-code generating function defined for them, and a function
	to test for equality of two keys. These two functions together
	must maintain the invariant that if equal(X, Y), then hash(X) ==
	hash(Y). Note that the converse will not generally be true (but
	the contrapositive, if hash(X) != hash(Y), then !equal(X, Y),
	will be as required by Boolean logic). If the hash() and equal()
	key callbacks are NULL, the key is used as a pointer-sized integer,
	and pointer equality is used. Care should be taken to provide a
	hash() callback which will compute sufficiently dispersed hash
	codes for the key set for best performance.

	Computational Complexity
	The access time for a value in the dictionary is guaranteed to be at
	worst O(N) for any implementation, current and future, but will
	often be O(1) (constant time). Insertion or deletion operations
	will typically be constant time as well, but are O(N*N) in the
	worst case in some implementations. Access of values through a key
	is faster than accessing values directly (if there are any such
	operations). Dictionaries will tend to use significantly more memory
	than a array with the same number of values.

		retain or release callbacks, the behavior is undefined.
