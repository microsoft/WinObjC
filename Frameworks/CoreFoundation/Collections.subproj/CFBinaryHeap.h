                ignore this hint, or may use it to optimize various

	@param callBacks A pointer to a CFBinaryHeapCallBacks structure
		initialized with the callbacks for the binary heap to use on
		each value in the binary heap. A copy of the contents of the
		callbacks structure is made, so that a pointer to a structure
		on the stack can be passed in, or can be reused for multiple
		binary heap creations. If the version field of this callbacks
		structure is not one of the defined ones for CFBinaryHeap, the
		behavior is undefined. The retain field may be NULL, in which
		case the CFBinaryHeap will do nothing to add a retain to values
		as they are put into the binary heap. The release field may be
		NULL, in which case the CFBinaryHeap will do nothing to remove
		the binary heap's retain (if any) on the values when the
		heap is destroyed or a key-value pair is removed. If the
		copyDescription field is NULL, the binary heap will create a
		simple description for a value. If the equal field is NULL, the
		binary heap will use pointer equality to test for equality of
		values. This callbacks parameter itself may be NULL, which is
		treated as if a valid structure of version 0 with all fields
		NULL had been passed in. Otherwise,
		if any of the fields are not valid pointers to functions
		of the correct type, or this parameter is not a valid
		pointer to a CFBinaryHeapCallBacks callbacks structure,
		the behavior is undefined. If any of the values put into the
		binary heap is not one understood by one of the callback functions
		the behavior when that callback function is used is undefined.
