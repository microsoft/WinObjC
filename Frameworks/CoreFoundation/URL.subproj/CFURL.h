/*
 All URLs can be broken into two pieces - the scheme (preceding the
 first colon) and the resource specifier (following the first colon).
 Most URLs are also "standard" URLs conforming to RFC 1808 (available
 from www.w3c.org).  This category includes URLs of the file, http,
 https, and ftp schemes, to name a few.  Standard URLs start the
 resource specifier with two slashes ("//"), and can be broken into
 four distinct pieces - the scheme, the net location, the path, and
 further resource specifiers (typically an optional parameter, query,
 and/or fragment).  The net location appears immediately following
 the two slashes and goes up to the next slash; it's format is
 scheme-specific, but is usually composed of some or all of a username,
 password, host name, and port.  The path is a series of path components
 separated by slashes; if the net location is present, the path always
 begins with a slash.  Standard URLs can be relative to another URL,
 in which case at least the scheme and possibly other pieces as well
 come from the base URL (see RFC 1808 for precise details when resolving
 a relative URL against its base).  The full URL is therefore
 
 <scheme> "://" <net location> <path, always starting with slash> <add'l resource specifiers>
 
 If a given CFURL can be decomposed (that is, conforms to RFC 1808), you
 can ask for each of the four basic pieces (scheme, net location, path,
 and resource specifer) separately, as well as for its base URL.  The
 basic pieces are returned with any percent escape sequences still in
 place (although note that the scheme may not legally include any
 percent escapes); this is to allow the caller to distinguish between
 percent sequences that may have syntactic meaning if replaced by the
 character being escaped (for instance, a '/' in a path component).
 Since only the individual schemes know which characters are
 syntactically significant, CFURL cannot safely replace any percent
 escape sequences.  However, you can use
 CFURLCreateStringByReplacingPercentEscapes() to create a new string with
 the percent escapes removed; see below.
 
 If a given CFURL can not be decomposed, you can ask for its scheme and its
 resource specifier; asking it for its net location or path will return NULL.
 
 To get more refined information about the components of a decomposable
 CFURL, you may ask for more specific pieces of the URL, expressed with
 the percent escapes removed.  The available functions are CFURLCopyHostName(),
 CFURLGetPortNumber() (returns an Int32), CFURLCopyUserName(),
 CFURLCopyPassword(), CFURLCopyQuery(), CFURLCopyParameters(), and
 CFURLCopyFragment().  Because the parameters, query, and fragment of an
 URL may contain scheme-specific syntaxes, these methods take a second
 argument, giving a list of characters which should NOT be replaced if
 percent escaped.  For instance, the ftp parameter syntax gives simple
 key-value pairs as "<key>=<value>;"  Clearly if a key or value includes
 either '=' or ';', it must be escaped to avoid corrupting the meaning of
 the parameters, so the caller may request the parameter string as
 
 CFStringRef myParams = CFURLCopyParameters(ftpURL, CFSTR("=;%"));
 
 requesting that all percent escape sequences be replaced by the represented
 characters, except for escaped '=', '%' or ';' characters.  Pass the empty
 string (CFSTR("")) to request that all percent escapes be replaced, or NULL
 to request that none be.

    The behavior of resource value caching is slightly different between the NSURL and CFURL API.

    When the NSURL methods which get, set, or use cached resource values are used from the main thread, resource values cached by the URL (except those added as temporary properties) are invalidated the next time the main thread's run loop runs.

    The CFURL functions do not automatically clear any resource values cached by the URL. The client has complete control over the cache lifetime. If you are using CFURL API, you must use CFURLClearResourcePropertyCacheForKey or CFURLClearResourcePropertyCache to clear cached resource values.

    Discussion
        CFURLCopyResourcePropertyForKey first checks if the URL object already caches the resource value. If so, it returns the cached resource value to the caller. If not, then CFURLCopyResourcePropertyForKey synchronously obtains the resource value from the backing store, adds the resource value to the URL object's cache, and returns the resource value to the caller. The type of the resource value varies by resource property (see resource key definitions). If this function returns true and propertyValueTypeRefPtr is populated with NULL, it means the resource property is not available for the specified resource and no errors occurred when determining the resource property was not available. If this function returns false, the optional error is populated. This function is currently applicable only to URLs for file system resources.

/*
    CFURLCopyResourcePropertiesForKeys
    
    Returns the resource values identified by specified array of resource keys.

    Parameters
        url
            The URL specifying the resource.
        keys
            An array of resource keys that identify the resource properties.
        error
            On output when the result is NULL, the error that occurred. This parameter is optional; if you do not wish the error returned, pass NULL here. The caller is responsible for releasing a valid output error.

    Return Value
        A dictionary of resource values indexed by resource key; NULL if an error occurs.

    Discussion
        CFURLCopyResourcePropertiesForKeys first checks if the URL object already caches the resource values. If so, it returns the cached resource values to the caller. If not, then CFURLCopyResourcePropertyForKey synchronously obtains the resource values from the backing store, adds the resource values to the URL object's cache, and returns the resource values to the caller. The type of the resource values vary by property (see resource key definitions). If the result dictionary does not contain a resource value for one or more of the requested resource keys, it means those resource properties are not available for the specified resource and no errors occurred when determining those resource properties were not available. If this function returns NULL, the optional error is populated. This function is currently applicable only to URLs for file system resources.

To remove a temporary value from the URL object, use CFURLClearResourcePropertyCacheForKey. Temporary values must be valid Core Foundation types, and will be retained by CFURLSetTemporaryResourcePropertyForKey. Care should be taken to ensure the key that identifies a temporary resource property is unique and does not conflict with system defined keys (using reverse domain name notation in your temporary resource property keys is recommended).

    Discussion
        CFURLResourceIsReachable synchronously checks if the resource's backing store is reachable. Checking reachability is appropriate when making decisions that do not require other immediate operations on the resource, e.g. periodic maintenance of UI state that depends on the existence of a specific document. When performing operations such as opening a file or copying resource properties, it is more efficient to simply try the operation and handle failures.
