/* Glitter-paths is a stand alone polygon rasteriser derived from
 * David Turner's reimplementation of Tor Anderssons's 15x17

 * main new feature here is cheaply choosing per-scan line between
 * doing fully analytical coverage computation for an entire row at a
 * time vs. using a supersampling approach.
 *
 * David Turner's code can be found at
 *
 *   http://david.freetype.org/rasterizer-shootout/raster-comparison-20070813.tar.bz2

 * In particular this file incorporates large parts of ftgrays_tor10.h

/* Overview
 *
 * A scan converter's basic purpose to take polygon edges and convert
 * them into an RLE compressed A8 mask.  This one works in two phases:
 * gathering edges and generating spans.
 *
 * 1) As the user feeds the scan converter edges they are vertically
 * clipped and bucketted into a _polygon_ data structure.  The edges
 * are also snapped from the user's coordinates to the subpixel grid
 * coordinates used during scan conversion.
 *
 *     user
 *      |
 *      | edges
 *      V
 *    polygon buckets
 *
 * 2) Generating spans works by performing a vertical sweep of pixel
 * rows from top to bottom and maintaining an _active_list_ of edges
 * that intersect the row.  From the active list the fill rule
 * determines which edges are the left and right edges of the start of
 * each span, and their contribution is then accumulated into a pixel
 * coverage list (_cell_list_) as coverage deltas.  Once the coverage
 * deltas of all edges are known we can form spans of constant pixel
 * coverage by summing the deltas during a traversal of the cell list.
 * At the end of a pixel row the cell list is sent to a coverage
 * blitter for rendering to some target surface.
 *
 * The pixel coverages are computed by either supersampling the row
 * and box filtering a mono rasterisation, or by computing the exact
 * coverages of edges in the active list.  The supersampling method is
 * used whenever some edge starts or stops within the row or there are
 * edge intersections in the row.
