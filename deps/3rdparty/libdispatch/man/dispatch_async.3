.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn dispatch_async
and
.Fn dispatch_sync
functions schedule blocks for concurrent execution within the
.Xr dispatch 3
framework. Blocks are submitted to a queue which dictates the policy for their
execution. See
.Xr dispatch_queue_create 3
for more information about creating dispatch queues.
.Pp
These functions support efficient temporal synchronization, background
concurrency and data-level concurrency. These same functions can also be used
for efficient notification of the completion of asynchronous blocks (a.k.a.
callbacks).
.Sh TEMPORAL SYNCHRONIZATION
Synchronization is often required when multiple threads of execution access
shared data concurrently. The simplest form of synchronization is
mutual-exclusion (a lock), whereby different subsystems execute concurrently
until a shared critical section is entered. In the
.Xr pthread 3
family of procedures, temporal synchronization is accomplished like so:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
int r = pthread_mutex_lock(&my_lock);
assert(r == 0);

// critical section

r = pthread_mutex_unlock(&my_lock);
assert(r == 0);
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fn dispatch_sync
function may be used with a serial queue to accomplish the same style of
synchronization. For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dispatch_sync(my_queue, ^{
	// critical section
});
.Ed
.Pp
In addition to providing a more concise expression of synchronization, this
approach is less error prone as the critical section cannot be accidentally
left without restoring the queue to a reentrant state.
.Pp
The
.Fn dispatch_async
function may be used to implement deferred critical sections when the result
of the block is not needed locally. Deferred critical sections have the same
synchronization properties as the above code, but are non-blocking and
therefore more efficient to perform. For example:
.Bd -literal
dispatch_async(my_queue, ^{
	// critical section
});
.Ed
.Sh BACKGROUND CONCURRENCY
.The
.Fn dispatch_async
function may be used to execute trivial backgound tasks on a global concurrent
queue. For example:
.Bd -literal
dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT,0), ^{
	// background operation
});
.Ed
.Pp
This approach is an efficient replacement for
.Xr pthread_create 3 .
.Sh COMPLETION CALLBACKS
Completion callbacks can be accomplished via nested calls to the
.Fn dispatch_async
function. It is important to remember to retain the destination queue before the
first call to
.Fn dispatch_async ,
and to release that queue at the end of the completion callback to ensure the
destination queue is not deallocated while the completion callback is pending.
For example:
.Bd -literal
void
async_read(object_t obj,
	void *where, size_t bytes,
	dispatch_queue_t destination_queue,
	void (^reply_block)(ssize_t r, int err))
{
	// There are better ways of doing async I/O.
	// This is just an example of nested blocks.

	dispatch_retain(destination_queue);
	
	dispatch_async(obj->queue, ^{
		ssize_t r = read(obj->fd, where, bytes);
		int err = errno;

		dispatch_async(destination_queue, ^{
			reply_block(r, err);
		}); 
		dispatch_release(destination_queue);
	});
}
.Ed
.Sh RECURSIVE LOCKS
While
.Fn dispatch_sync
can replace a lock, it cannot replace a recursive lock. Unlike locks, queues
support both asynchronous and synchronous operations, and those operations are
ordered by definition. A recursive call to
.Fn dispatch_sync
causes a simple deadlock as the currently executing block waits for the next
block to complete, but the next block will not start until the currently
running block completes.
.Pp
As the dispatch framework was designed, we studied recursive locks. We found
that the vast majority of recursive locks are deployed retroactively when
ill-defined lock hierarchies are discovered. As a consequence, the adoption of
recursive locks often mutates obvious bugs into obscure ones. This study also
revealed an insight: if reentrancy is unavoidable, then reader/writer locks are
preferable to recursive locks. Disciplined use of reader/writer locks enable
reentrancy only when reentrancy is safe (the "read" side of the lock).
.Pp
Nevertheless, if it is absolutely necessary, what follows is an imperfect way of
implementing recursive locks using the dispatch framework:
.Bd -literal
void
sloppy_lock(object_t object, void (^block)(void))
{
	if (object->owner == pthread_self()) {
		return block();
	}
	dispatch_sync(object->queue, ^{
		object->owner = pthread_self();
		block();
		object->owner = NULL;
	});
}
.Ed
.Pp
The above example does not solve the case where queue A runs on thread X which
calls
.Fn dispatch_sync
against queue B which runs on thread Y which recursively calls
.Fn dispatch_sync
against queue A, which deadlocks both examples. This is bug-for-bug compatible
with nontrivial pthread usage. In fact, nontrivial reentrancy is impossible to
support in recursive locks once the ultimate level of reentrancy is deployed
(IPC or RPC). 
.Sh IMPLIED REFERENCES
Synchronous functions within the dispatch framework hold an implied reference
on the target queue. In other words, the synchronous function borrows the
reference of the calling function (this is valid because the calling function
is blocked waiting for the result of the synchronous function, and therefore
cannot modify the reference count of the target queue until after the
synchronous function has returned).
For example:
.Bd -literal
queue = dispatch_queue_create("com.example.queue", NULL);
assert(queue);
dispatch_sync(queue, ^{
	do_something();
	//dispatch_release(queue); // NOT SAFE -- dispatch_sync() is still using 'queue'
});
dispatch_release(queue); // SAFELY balanced outside of the block provided to dispatch_sync()
.Ed
.Pp
This is in contrast to asynchronous functions which must retain both the block
and target queue for the duration of the asynchronous operation (as the calling
function may immediately release its interest in these objects).
.Sh FUNDAMENTALS
Conceptually,
.Fn dispatch_sync
is a convenient wrapper around
.Fn dispatch_async
with the addition of a semaphore to wait for completion of the block, and a
wrapper around the block to signal its completion. See
.Xr dispatch_semaphore_create 3
for more information about dispatch semaphores. The actual implementation of the
.Fn dispatch_sync
function may be optimized and differ from the above description.
.Pp
The
.Fn dispatch_async
function is a wrapper around
.Fn dispatch_async_f .
The application-defined
.Fa context
parameter is passed to the
.Fa function
when it is invoked on the target
.Fa queue .
